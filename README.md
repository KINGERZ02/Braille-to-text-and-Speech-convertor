# Braille-to-text-and-Speech-convertor
Braille is a tactile writing system used by visually impaired individuals, consisting of raised dots arranged in cells to represent characters. Converting Braille into readable text and audible output is a significant accessibility tool. This project, 'Braille to Text and Speech Converter,' aims to create a system that translates Braille input into both text and speech, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
The project utilizes a Python script to convert Braille dots into an array representing each letter. This array is then processed in LabVIEW, where it is translated into text and subsequently into speech. This report provides an in-depth overview of each component, detailing the design, implementation, and results of the system.
